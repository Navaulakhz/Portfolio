        <h2>About Me</h2>
<br>
        <br>
        <p>As a college student with a passion for drawing, 
            I have honed my skills in both traditional and digital art over the years. 
            My skill set includes proficiency in various drawing mediums such as pencil, 
            ink, charcoal, and digital tools like Adobe Photoshop and Procreate. 
            I excel in creating detailed illustrations, character designs, and concept art.

            In terms of previous projects, I have participated in several 
            art exhibitions and contests, receiving recognition for my work.
            I also collaborated with local businesses to create custom illustrations 
            for their promotional materials, including logos and merchandise designs.
            
            My work experience includes freelance commissions for clients 
            seeking personalized artwork. Additionally, 
            I have volunteered my artistic abilities to create murals 
            and decorations for community events and college organizations.
            
            I am constantly seeking opportunities to further develop
             my artistic talents and contribute to creative projects. 
            My portfolio showcases my versatility, dedication, 
            and love for the art, making me an asset for any artistic endeavor.</p>
